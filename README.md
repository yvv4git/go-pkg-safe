# Package Versioning Policy

## Restrictions on Installing the Latest Version

To ensure stability and security, **installing the latest version of a package is not allowed**. The latest version may introduce breaking changes, untested features, or security vulnerabilities. Instead, use a tested and verified version that meets stability criteria. For example zeroday vulnerability.

## Quarantine Period for New Versions

Any package version **younger than 14 days** is considered to be in **quarantine**. During this period:
- New versions are not automatically considered safe.
- They require additional review and testing before use.

This policy helps to prevent issues caused by premature adoption of unstable or compromised versions.

## Recommended Approach
- Use **previous stable versions** instead of the latest.
- Wait for **at least 14 days** before considering a newly released version.
- Follow security advisories and community feedback before upgrading.

By following these guidelines, we ensure a more stable and secure development environment.
